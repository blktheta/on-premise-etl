A basic On-Premise ETL pipeline showcasing Python/SQL best practices and fundamental knowledge on dimensional modeling. The project currently make use of a small dataset in order to showcase the necessary steps taken when preparing data. 

The infrastructre of the project can be seen below. This project is meant to showcase each step of the cycle, all the way from the initial extraction of the data to the business report. Including data from different sources.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting started
1. First, [download][py_download_url] and install **Python**. Version `3.7` or higher is required.
2. Secondly, [download][pg_download_url] and install **PostgreSQL**. Version `10` or higher is required.

With both software installed create a `.env` file within the **src/util/** directory and paste in following code. Make sure to remove the templated text with your own configuration.
```env
USER='your-username'
PASSWORD='your-password'
HOST='database-host'
PORT='database-port'
DBNAME='database-name'
```

Now run the following commands via the terminal, from your project root directory, or in this case repo root directory. The snippet below creates a Python `venv`, activates it, and installs the Python dependencies required to run this project.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The setup is now finished and you can now move onwards üöÄ.

## üî° Dimensional modeling
Dimensional modeling supports business users to query data in a data warehouse system and is oriented to improve the query perfomance and ease of use.

The project is built based on star schema with fact tables at the center surrounded by a number of dimension tables. The following four-step process was used in determining the design of the dimension and fact tables:
1. **Choosing business process to a model** ‚Äì The first step is to decide what business process to model by gathering and understanding business needs and available data.
2. **Declare the grain** - The second step is to describe exactly what a fact table record represents.
3. **Choose the dimensions** ‚Äì The third step is to determine dimensions for the fact table.
4. **Identify facts** ‚Äì The forth step is to identify carefully which facts will appear in the fact table.

The following images below showcase the transformation of the dataset from an OLTP or source source system to OLAP or data warehouse.

## üîß Usage
Create a new database and restore the backup database `after_filmrental.tar` into it. 
```bash
pg_restore -U username -d dbname path/to/after_filmrental.tar
```
Or, restore `before_filmrental.tar` backup and apply the `SQL` transformations by running this command in psql.
```postgresql
\i path/to/src/sql/staging.sql
```
 Navigate to the **src/util** directory in the terminal and activate a Python interactive session. 
 ```bash
cd path/to/src/util
python3
```

Now you can access the fact tables and fact views using `SQL` and save them into a `Pandas` dataframe for examination.
```python
>>> from db import DatabaseConnection
>>> db = DatabaseConnection()
>>> df = db.fetch("""SELECT category, amount FROM fact.sales_master;""")  # Fetch data from Fact View table 
>>> df2 = df.groupby('category', as_index=False).sum().sort_vales('amount)
>>> df2
       category   amount
11        Music  3071.52
15       Travel  3227.36
2      Children  3309.39
3      Classics  3353.38
10       Horror  3401.27
5   Documentary  3749.65
7        Family  3830.15
9         Games  3922.18
8       Foreign  3934.47
0        Action  3951.84
12          New  3966.38
4        Comedy  4002.48
6         Drama  4118.46
1     Animation  4245.31
13       Sci-Fi  4336.01
14       Sports  4892.19
```

If `Matplotlib` is imported creating figures from the data can be accomplished quickly.
```python
>>> from matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
>>> ax.pie(df2['amount'], labels=df2['category'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
>>> plt.show()
```
